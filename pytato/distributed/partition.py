    r"""
    Compute a :class:DistributedGraphPartition` (for use with
    :func:`execute_distributed_partition`) that evaluates the
    same result as *outputs*, such that:

    - communication only happens at the beginning and end of
      each :class:`DistributedGraphPart`, and
    - the partition introduces no circular dependencies between parts,
      mediated by either local data flow or off-rank communication.

    .. warning::

        This is an MPI-collective operation.

    The following sections describe the (non-binding, as far as documentation
    is concerned) algorithm behind the partitioner.

    .. rubric:: Preliminaries

    We identify a communication operation (consisting of a pair of a send
    and a receive) by a
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationOpIdentifier`. We keep
    graphs of these in
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`.

    If ``graph`` is a
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`, then ``b in
    graph[a]`` means that, in order to initiate the communication operation
    identified by :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationOpIdentifier`
    ``a``, the communication operation identified by
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationOpIdentifier` ``b`` must
    be completed.

    I.e. the nodes are "communication operations", i.e. pairs of
    send/receive. Edges represent (rank-local) data flow between them.

    .. rubric:: Step 1: Build a global graph of data flow between communication
        operations

    On rank ``i``, collect the receives that have a data flow to that send
    in a :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`
    ``local_comm_ids_to_needed_comm_ids data structure``

    Let ``gathered_local_send_to_needed_local_recvs[i]`` be the
    ``local_comm_ids_to_needed_comm_ids`` gathered on rank ``i``. Since each
    send is carried out by exactly one rank, :math:`\bigcup_i`
    ``gathered_local_send_to_needed_local_recvs[i].keys()`` is disjoint, and
    thus simply combining all the dictionaries by key yields the rank-global
    graph of data flow between communication operations.

    Using allreduce (with disjoint union of :class:`dict` as the operation) of
    the local-pieces, this global graph will be conveyed to each rank. Each
    rank will then have the same global
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`
    ``comm_ids_to_needed_comm_ids``.

    .. rubric:: Step 2: Collect rank-local sends needed by each receive

    On rank ``i``, do the following:

    For each communicaton operation with destination rank ``i`` (i.e., from
    the point of view of rank ``i``, a receive), (recursively) find all
    needed communications with source rank ``i`` (i.e., from the point of
    view of rank ``i``, a send). Record these in
    :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`
    ``local_recv_id_to_needed_local_send_ids``.

    .. rubric:: Step 3: Obtain a rank-local communication dependency graph

    On rank ``i``, do the following:

    Define :class:`~pytato.distributed.partition.CommunicationDepGraph`
    ``local_comm_to_needed_local_comms`` as the key-wise disjoint union of
    ``local_comm_ids_to_needed_comm_ids`` and
    ``local_recv_id_to_needed_local_send_ids``.

    This graph now carries globally valid information on dependencies
    between communication operations taking place on the local rank.

    .. rubric:: Step 4: Partition the graph of local communication ops

    On rank ``i``, do the following:

    Compute a topological order of ``local_comm_to_needed_local_comms``.

    Starting from a single communication operation, greedily pack additional
    communication operations into the current part if:

    -  the additional operation is a send
    -  the additional operation is a receive that does not “need” (according
        to ``local_recv_id_to_needed_local_send_ids``) a send in the current part.
        Partitions *outputs* into parts. Between two parts communication
        statements (sends/receives) are scheduled.

    """
    # FIXME: Massage salvageable bits from old docstring into new.
    """
    -------

    .. note::

        The partitioning of a DAG generally does not have a unique solution.
        The heuristic employed by this partitioner is as follows:

        1. The data contained in :class:`~pytato.DistributedSend` are marked as
           *mandatory part outputs*.
        2. Based on the dependencies in *outputs*, a DAG is constructed with
           only the mandatory part outputs as the nodes.
        3. Using a topological sort the mandatory part outputs are assigned a
           "time" (an integer) such that evaluating these outputs at that time
           would preserve dependencies. We maximize the number of part outputs
           scheduled at a each "time". This requirement ensures our topological
           sort is deterministic.
        4. We then turn our attention to the other arrays that are allocated to a
           buffer. These are the materialized arrays and belong to one of the
           following classes:
           - An :class:`~pytato.Array` tagged with :class:`pytato.tags.ImplStored`.
           - The expressions in a :class:`~pytato.DictOfNamedArrays`.
        5. Based on *outputs*, we compute the predecessors of a materialized
           that were a part of the mandatory part outputs. A materialized array
           is scheduled to be evaluated in a part as soon as all of its inputs
           are available. Note that certain inputs (like
           :class:`~pytato.DistributedRecv`) might not be available until
           certain mandatory part outputs have been evaluated.
        6. From *outputs*, we can construct a DAG comprising only of mandatory
           part outputs and materialized arrays. We mark all materialized
           arrays that are being used by nodes in a part that's not the one in
           which the materialized array itself was evaluated. Such materialized
           arrays are also realized as part outputs. This is done to avoid
           recomputations.

        Knobs to tweak the partition:

        1. By removing dependencies between the mandatory part outputs, the
           resulting DAG would lead to fewer number of parts and parts with
           more number of nodes in them. Similarly, adding dependencies between
           the part outputs would lead to smaller parts.
        2. Tagging nodes with :class:~pytato.tags.ImplStored` would help in
           avoiding re-computations.
