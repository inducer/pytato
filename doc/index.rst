Welcome to Pytato's documentation!
==================================

Imagine TensorFlow, but aimed at HPC. Produces a data flow graph, where the
edges carry arrays and the nodes are (give or take) static-control programs
that compute array outputs from inputs, possibly (but not necessarily)
expressed in `Loopy <https://github.com/inducer/loopy>`__. A core assumption is
that the graph represents a computation that's being repeated often enough that
it is worthwhile to do expensive processing on it (code generation, fusion,
OpenCL compilation, etc).

Here's an example usage:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/demo.py

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :caption: Contents:

    array
    dag
    codegen
    internal
    design
    misc
